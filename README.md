# Simple Command-Line Calculator in Java

This project is a basic command-line calculator implemented in Java. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and select an operation, then displays the result.
This project is designed to test and demonstrate basic Java concepts.

- **Subtraction (-):** Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication (*):** Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division (/):** Divides the first number by the second.
- **Modulo (%):** Returns the remainder of the division of the first number by the second.
- **Exponentiation (^):** Raises the first number to the power of the second.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile and run the `Main` class in your preferred IDE or command-line interface.
3. Follow the prompts to enter two numbers and select an operation.
4. The result will be displayed in the console.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
